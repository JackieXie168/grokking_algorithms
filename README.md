# Grokking Algorithms
<span id="introduction"></span>
## Introduction

This is the code in my book [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/bhargava).
example codes could be download from [here](https://github.com/egonschiele/grokking_algorithms) 
Also check out [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/), a great website that helps you step through Python code line by line.

## Contributing
- The examples in this book are in Python, but I'd like to get examples in Ruby, JavaScript, C, and other languages too. Please add examples in other languages!
- I'm pretty responsive to PRs. That is the quickest way to contribute to this repo.
