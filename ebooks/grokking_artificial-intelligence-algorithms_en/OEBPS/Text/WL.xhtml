  <p class="body">Thank you for choosing the MEAP edition of Grokking Artificial Intelligence Algorithms. I hope for this book to demystify AI concepts and provide value to you and your work or passion projects. Your constructive feedback and opinions are graciously welcomed and will be a crucial aspect of making this book the best it can be.</p>

  <p class="body">Grokking Artificial Intelligence Algorithms is intended to be an intuitive and visual introduction to the algorithms that are useful in solving hard problems and creating intelligent applications. It spans the underrated retro algorithms as well as modern approaches to AI. It is aimed at developers who have an interest in artificial intelligence, biology inspired algorithms, machine learning, and widening their knowledge of algorithms in general; and favor practical visual explanations over theoretical proofs. My intention is to teach the concepts such that they can be applied immediately and form a grounding for further detailed learning if you choose to.</p>

  <p class="body">To get the most out of this book, an understanding of fundamental programming concepts, representing data for computation, and basic algebra are useful prerequisite skills. With that said, many of these concepts are briefly explained when needed in case you’ve forgotten.</p>

  <p class="body">We will be covering algorithms within the following areas:</p>

  <p class="listbulletcxspfirst">·   Searching: An old tool that is still useful today and used in more places than you would think.</p>

  <p class="listbulletcxspfirst">·   Evolutionary algorithms: Solving problems inspired by the theory of evolution.</p>

  <p class="listbulletcxspfirst">·   Swarm intelligence: Finding solutions by harnessing emergent behavior of masses.</p>

  <p class="listbulletcxspfirst">·   Machine learning: Making classifications and predictions using a statistical approach.</p>

  <p class="listbulletcxspfirst">·   Neural networks: Recognizing patterns and making predictions inspired by how our brains work.</p>

  <p class="listbulletcxspfirst">·   Reinforcement learning: Teach decision making by rewarding and penalizing. Just like raising kids.</p>

  <p class="body">Please note, Python code examples for the algorithms in the book are available here: <a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1" href="https://github.com/rishal-hurbans/Grokking-Artificial-Intelligence-Algorithms">https://github.com/rishal-hurbans/Grokking-Artificial-Intelligence-Algorithms</a></p>

  <p class="body">Once again, your feedback is highly appreciated. My goal with this book is to make AI concepts and algorithms accessible to as many technologists as possible. If there is any confusion, ambiguity, gaps, or something you’d like added, please make yourself heard.</p>
