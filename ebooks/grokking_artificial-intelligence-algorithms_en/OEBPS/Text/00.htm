    <p class="body1">This preface aims to describe the evolution of technology, our need to automate, and our responsibility to make ethical decisions while using artificial intelligence in building the future.</p>

    <h2 class="head" id="sigil_toc_id_2">0.1<span class="calibre10">     </span> Our obsession with technology and automation</h2>

    <p class="body1">Throughout history, we have had a hunger to solve problems while reducing manual labor and human effort. We have always strived for survival and conservation of our energy through the development of tools and automation of tasks. Some may argue that we are beautiful minds that seek innovation through creative problem-solving or creative works of literature, music, and art, but this book wasn’t written to discuss philosophical questions about our being. This is an overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches that can be harnessed to address real-world problems practically. We solve hard problems to make living easier, safer, healthier, more fulfilling, and more enjoyable. All the advancements that you see in history and around the world today, including AI, address the needs of individuals, communities, and nations.</p>

    <p class="body1">To shape our future, we must understand some key milestones in our past. In many revolutions, human innovation changed the way we live, and shaped the way we interact with the world and the way we think about it. We continue to do this as we iterate and improve the tools we use, which open future possibilities.</p>

    <p class="body1">This short high-level material on history and philosophy is provided purely to establish a baseline understanding of technology and AI, and to spur thought on responsible decision-making when embarking on your projects.</p>

    <p class="figurecaption">A brief timeline of technological improvements in history</p>

    <p class="body1">In the timeline figure, notice the compression of the milestones in more recent times. In the past 30 years, the most notable advancements have been in the improvement of microchips, the wide adoption of personal computers, the boom of networked devices, and the digitization of industries to break physical borders and connect the world. These are also the reasons that artificial intelligence has become a feasible and sensible area to pursue.</p>

    <p class="listbulletcxspfirst1"><span class="calibre13">§<span class="calibre14"> </span></span> The internet has connected the world and made it possible to collect mass amounts of data about almost anything.</p>

    <p class="listbulletcxspmiddle"><span class="calibre13">§<span class="calibre14"> </span></span> Advancements in computing hardware has given us the means to compute previously known algorithms using data while discovering new algorithms along the way.</p>

    <p class="listbulletcxsplast"><span class="calibre13">§<span class="calibre14"> </span></span> Industries have seen a need to leverage data and algorithms to make better decisions, solve harder problems, offer better solutions, and optimize our lives as people have done since the beginning of humanity.</p>

    <p class="body1">Although we tend to think of technological progress as linear, by examining our history, we find that it is more likely that our progress is and will be exponential. Advancements in technology will move faster each year that goes by. New tools and techniques need to be learned, but <span class="italics">problem solving fundamentals</span> underpin everything.</p>

    <p class="body1">This book includes foundation-level concepts that help solve hard problems, but it also aims to make learning the more complex concepts easier.</p>

    <h3 class="head1" id="sigil_toc_id_3">0.1.1<span class="calibre15">  </span> We’re wired to automate</h3>

    <p class="body1">Automation can be perceived differently by different people. For a technologist, automation may mean writing scripts that make software development, deployment, and distribution seamless and less error-prone. For an engineer, it may mean streamlining a factory line for more throughput or fewer defects. For a farmer, it may mean using tools to optimize the yield of crops through automatic tractors and irrigation systems. Automation is any solution that reduces the need for human energy to favor productivity or add superior value compared with what a manual intervention would have added.</p>

    <p class="figure"><img alt="00_03" class="calibre11" src="../Images/00_03.png"/><br class="calibre12"/></p>

    <p class="figurecaption">Manual processes versus automated processes</p>

    <p class="body1">If we think about reasons not to automate, one prominent reason is simply that a person can do the task better, with less chance of failure and better accuracy, if the task requires intuition about several perspectives in a situation, when abstract creative thinking is required, or when understanding social interactions and the nature of people is important.</p>

    <p class="body1">Nurses don’t simply complete tasks, but connect with and take care of their patients. Studies show that the human interaction by caring people is a factor in the healing process. Teachers don’t simply offload knowledge, but find creative ways to present knowledge, mentor, and guide students based on their ability, personality, and interests. That said, there is a place for automation through technology and a place for people. With the innovations of today, automation via technology will be a close companion to any occupation.</p>

    <h2 class="head" id="sigil_toc_id_4">0.2<span class="calibre10">     </span> Ethics, legal matters, and our responsibility</h2>

    <p class="body1">You may be wondering why a section on ethics and responsibility is in a technical book. Well, as we progress towards a world in which technology is intertwined with the way of life, the ones who create the technology have more power than they know. Small contributions can have massive knock-on effects. It important that our intentions be benevolent and that the output of our work not be harmful.</p>

    <p class="figure"><img alt="00_04" class="calibre11" src="../Images/00_04.png"/><br class="calibre12"/></p>

    <p class="figurecaption">Aim for ethical and legal applications of technology</p>

    <h3 class="head1" id="sigil_toc_id_5">0.2.1<span class="calibre15">  </span> Intention and impact: Understanding your vision and goals</h3>

    <p class="body1">When you develop anything—such as a new physical product, service, or software—there’s always a question about the intention behind it. Are you developing software that affects the world positively, or is your intention malevolent? Have you thought about the broader impact of what you’re developing? Businesses always find ways to become more profitable and powerful, which is the whole point of growing a business. They use strategies to determine the best ways to beat the competition, gain more customers, and become even more influential. That said, businesses must ask themselves whether their intentions are pure, not only for the survival of the business, but also for the good of their customers and society in general. Many famous scientists, engineers, and technologists have expressed a need to govern the use of AI to prevent misuse. As individuals, we also have an ethical obligation to do what is right and establish a strong core set of values. When you’re asked to do something that violates your principles, it is important to voice those principles.</p>

    <h3 class="head1" id="sigil_toc_id_6">0.2.2<span class="calibre15">  </span> Unintended use: Protecting against malicious use</h3>

    <p class="body1">It is important to identify and protect against unintended use. Although this may seem obvious and easy to accomplish, it is difficult to understand how people will use whatever you are creating, and even more difficult to predict whether it aligns with your values and the values of the organization.</p>

    <p class="body1">An example is the loudspeaker, which was invented by Peter Jensen in 1915. The loudspeaker was originally called Magnavox, which was initially used to play opera music to large crowds in San Francisco, which is quite a benevolent use of the technology. The Nazi regime in Germany had other ideas, however: they placed loudspeakers in public places in such a way that everyone was subjected to hearing Hitler’s speeches and announcements. Because the monologues were unavoidable, people became more susceptible to Hitler’s ideas, and after this, the Nazi regime gained the majority of its support in Germany. This is not what Jensen envisioned his invention being used for, but there’s not much he could have done about it.</p>

    <p class="body1">Times have changed, and we have more control of the things we build, especially software. It is still difficult to imagine how the technology you build may be used, but it is almost guaranteed that someone will find a way to use it in a way that you didn’t intend, with positive or negative consequences. Given this fact, we as professionals in the technology industry and the organizations we work with must think of ways to mitigate malevolent use as far as possible.</p>

    <h3 class="head1" id="sigil_toc_id_7">0.2.3<span class="calibre15">  </span> Unintended bias: Building solutions for everyone</h3>

    <p class="body1">When building AI systems, we use our understanding of contexts and domains. We also use algorithms that find patterns in data and act on it. It can’t be denied that there is bias all around us. A bias is a prejudice against a person or group of people, including their gender, race, and beliefs. Many of these biases arise from emergent behavior in social interactions, events in history, and cultural and political views around the world. These biases affect the data that we collect. Because AI algorithms work with this data, it is an inherent problem that the machine will “learn” these biases. From a technical perspective, we can engineer the system perfectly, but at the end of the day, humans interact with these systems, and it’s our responsibility to minimize bias and prejudice as much as possible. The algorithms we use are only as good as the data provided to them. Understanding the data and the context in which it is being used is the first step in battling bias, and this understanding will help you build better models - because you will be well versed in the problem space. Providing balanced data with as little bias as possible should result in better solutions.</p>

    <h3 class="head1" id="sigil_toc_id_8">0.2.4<span class="calibre15">  </span> The law, privacy, and consent: Knowing the importance of core values</h3>

    <p class="body1">The legal aspect of what we do is hugely important. The law governs what we can and cannot do in the interest of society as a whole. Due to the fact that many laws were written in a time when computers and the internet were not as important in our lives as they are today, we find many gray areas in how we develop technology and what we are allowed to do with that technology. That said, laws are slowly changing to adapt to the rapid innovation in technology.</p>

    <p class="body1">We are compromising our privacy almost every hour of every day via our interactions on computers, mobile phones, and other devices, for example. We are transmitting a vast amount of information about ourselves, some more personal than others. How is that data being processed and stored? We should consider these facts when building solutions. People should have a choice about what data is captured, processed, and stored about them; how that data is used; and who can potentially access that data. In my experience, people generally accept solutions that use their data to improve the products they use and add more value to their lives. Most importantly, people are most accepting when they are given a choice and that choice is respected.</p>

    <h3 class="head1" id="sigil_toc_id_9">0.2.5<span class="calibre15">  </span> Singularity: Exploring the unknown</h3>

    <p class="body1">The <span class="italics">singularity</span> is the idea that we create an AI that is so generally intelligent that it is capable of improving itself and expanding its intelligence to a stage where it becomes super intelligence. The concern is that something of this magnitude cannot be understood by humans which could change civilization as we know it for reasons we can’t even comprehend. Some people are concerned that this intelligence may see humans as a threat; others propose that we may be to a super intelligence what ants are to us. We don’t pay explicit attention to ants or concern ourselves with how they live, but if we are irritated by them, we deal with them in isolation.</p>

    <p class="body1">Whether these assumptions are accurate representations of the future or not, we must be responsible and think about the decisions we make, as they ultimately affect a person, a group of people, or the world at large.</p>
